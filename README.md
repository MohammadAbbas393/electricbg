I developed a similar code by modifying various elements, inspired by a project I'm working on with the Digital Learning and Inquiry (DLINQ) ITS department at Middlebury College. The project involves creating a website for them, scheduled for June 24, 2024. I incorporated this concept into the header because I believed adding some technology and motion would enhance the ITS website.
